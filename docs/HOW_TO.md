### <a name="flvmainf"></a>Where flavor main files are located in?

Main files are located in: 

```
lib/app/flavors
```

### <a name="apicomp"></a>Where API client base components are located in?

Base API client components are located in:

```
lib/core/arch/data/remote
```

Here you can find all the base classes which that are included in the API client module.

Base API url and API client name are located in:

```
lib/core/arch/data/remote/dio/dio_const.dart
```

You free to add as much URls you need and declare a new API clients to use with different urls.

Also here a few examples of request interceptors in `/interceptor` folder. You can use any you like or your own
implementation but not forgot to declare chosen interceptor in the `ApiClient`.

### <a name="fails"></a>How I can add new failure types?

Just go to `lib/core/arch/domain/entity/failure` folder and create any much new custom failures you need. 
But be aware that you new failure classes must implement base `Failure` class.
